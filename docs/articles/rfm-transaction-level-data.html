<p><strong>RFM</strong> (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a
behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their
transaction history such as</p>
<ul>
<li>how recently a customer has purchased (recency)</li>
<li>how often they purchase (frequency)</li>
<li>how much the customer spends (monetary)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is based on the marketing axiom that <strong>80% of your business
comes from 20% of your customers</strong>. RFM helps to identify
customers who are more likely to respond to promotions by segmenting
them into various categories.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="data">Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data"></a>
</h2>
<p>To calculate the RFM score for each customer we need transaction data
which should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a unique customer id</li>
<li>date of transaction/order</li>
<li>transaction/order amount</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rfm-score">RFM Score<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rfm-score"></a>
</h2>
<p>So how is the RFM score computed for each customer? The below steps
explain the process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A recency score is assigned to each customer based on date of
most recent purchase. The score is generated by binning the recency
values into a number of categories (default is 5). For example, if you
use four categories, the customers with the most recent purchase dates
receive a recency ranking of 4, and those with purchase dates in the
distant past receive a recency ranking of 1.</p></li>
<li><p>A frequency ranking is assigned in a similar way. Customers with
high purchase frequency are assigned a higher score (4 or 5) and those
with lowest frequency are assigned a score 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Monetary score is assigned on the basis of the total revenue
generated by the customer in the period under consideration for the
analysis. Customers with highest revenue/order amount are assigned a
higher score while those with lowest revenue are assigned a score of
1.</p></li>
<li><p>A fourth score, RFM score is generated which is simply the three
individual scores concatenated into a single value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The customers with the highest RFM scores are most likely to respond
to an offer. Now that we have understood how the RFM score is computed,
it is time to put it into practice. Use <code><a href="../reference/rfm_table_order.html">rfm_table_order()</a></code>
to generate the score for each customer from the sample data set
<code>rfm_data_orders</code>.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/rfm_table_order.html">rfm_table_order()</a></code> takes 8 inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>data</code>: a data set with
<ul>
<li>unique customer id</li>
<li>date of transaction</li>
<li>and amount</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>customer_id</code>: name of the customer id column</li>
<li>
<code>order_date</code>: name of the transaction date column</li>
<li>
<code>revenue</code>: name of the transaction amount column</li>
<li>
<code>analysis_date</code>: date of analysis</li>
<li>
<code>recency_bins</code>: number of rankings for recency score
(default is 5)</li>
<li>
<code>frequency_bins</code>: number of rankings for frequency score
(default is 5)</li>
<li>
<code>monetary_bins</code>: number of rankings for monetary score
(default is 5)</li>
</ul>

<p>The best customers are those who:</p>
<ul>
<li>bought most recently</li>
<li>most often</li>
<li>and spend the most</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us examine the relationship between the above.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="recency-vs-monetary-value">Recency vs Monetary Value<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recency-vs-monetary-value"></a>
</h4>
<p>Customers who visited more recently generated more revenue compared
to those who visited in the distant past. The customers who visited in
the recent past are more likely to return compared to those who visited
long time ago as most of those would be lost customers. As such, higher
revenue would be associated with most recent visits.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="frequency-vs-monetary-value">Frequency vs Monetary Value<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#frequency-vs-monetary-value"></a>
</h4>
<p>As the frequency of visits increases, the revenue generated also
increases. Customers who visit more frquently are your champion
customers, loyal customers or potential loyalists and they drive higher
revenue.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/rfm_rm_plot.html">rfm_fm_plot</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">rfm_result</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>

</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="recency-vs-frequency">Recency vs Frequency<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recency-vs-frequency"></a>
</h4>
<p>Customers with low frequency visited in the distant past while those
with high frequency have visited in the recent past. Again, the
customers who visited in the recent past are more likely to return
compared to those who visited long time ago. As such, higher frequency
would be associated with the most recent visits.</p>

<p>Now that we have defined and segmented our customers, let us examine
the distribution of customers across the segments. Ideally, we should
have very few or no customer in segments such as <code>At Risk</code> or
<code>Needs Attention</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span class="co">##              Segment Count</span>
<span class="co">## 1    Loyal Customers   278</span>
<span class="co">## 2 Potential Loyalist   229</span>
<span class="co">## 3          Champions   158</span>
<span class="co">## 4               Lost   111</span>
<span class="co">## 5            At Risk    86</span>
<span class="co">## 6     About To Sleep    50</span>
<span class="co">## 7             Others    48</span>
<span class="co">## 8     Need Attention    35</span></code></pre>
<p>We can also examine the median recency, frequency and monetary value
across segments to ensure that the logic used for customer
classification is sound and practical.</p>
